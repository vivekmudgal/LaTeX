\begin{rSection}{Position of Responsibility}

\begin{rSubsection}{Technology Robotix Society, IIT Kharagpur}{February 2017-Present}{Head}{}
\item I am responsible for designing an autonomous event to be held at Kshitij 2018, Asia’s largest techno-
management fest. I help conduct technical workshops across India to spread the culture of robotics. Also
I organize weekly lectures on manual and autonomous robotics for over 300 students round the year along with
workshops and hackathons. I lead a three-tier team to successful planning and execution of all these events.

\end{rSubsection}



\begin{rSubsection}{IEEE Robotics Winter Workshop}{December 2016}{Autonomous Robotics Mentor}{}
\item I conducted a week-long workshop for 43 first and second year undergraduates at IIT Kharagpur. As a final project of the workshop I helped the students build a gesture controlled robot capable of removing small obstacles in its path. I taught about microcontrollers, and concepts like ADC, Timers, Interrupts, Communication Protocols and basic control theory.
